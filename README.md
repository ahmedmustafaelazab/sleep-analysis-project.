## 🔍 Analysis Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Checked missing values, data types, and consistency.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Sleep duration distribution  
   - Relationship between stress level & sleep quality  
   - Impact of BMI category on sleep  
   - Sleep disorders prevalence  
   - Effect of daily steps & physical activity  
3. **Insights & Observations**  
   - Added Markdown notes after each visualization.  
4. **Conclusion & Recommendations**  
   - Summarized key findings & provided actionable advice.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Ideal sleep duration**: 7–8 hours leads to the highest quality sleep.  
- **Stress**: Higher stress levels significantly reduce sleep quality, especially for those with insomnia.  
- **Sleep Disorders**: Insomnia is the most common disorder, followed by Sleep Apnea.  
- **BMI**: Normal BMI category shows slightly better sleep duration than overweight/obese categories.  
- **Activity**: Higher physical activity and daily steps show a mild positive impact on sleep duration and quality.

## ✅ Conclusion  
Sleep quality is influenced by multiple lifestyle and health factors.  
Stress and sleep disorders have the strongest negative impact, while physical activity and maintaining a healthy BMI are associated with better sleep.

## 💡 Recommendations  
1. Aim for **7–8 hours of sleep** per night.  
2. Reduce stress through relaxation techniques (e.g., meditation, deep breathing, time management).  
3. Engage in **regular physical activity** such as walking or exercise.  
4. Maintain a **consistent sleep schedule** (same bedtime and wake-up time).  
5. Consult a specialist if experiencing sleep disorders such as insomnia or sleep apnea.
